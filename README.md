Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of computer software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering has to do with the  process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by following a set of engineering principles and best practices.

Software engineering differs from traditional programming because it does not only center around codes but the entire life cycle of the program or application.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) lists  several tasks necessary to build a software application. 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
planning: This is when the team plans for the softwae development
analysis: After planning, the software to be developed will be analyzed.
design: The desgn of the software will be adopted.
development: after these first three phases, the team will proceed to develop the sofrware.
testing: After development, it the team will have to test the software rigorously to be sure it is okay to be implemented.
implementation: This is the stage when the software will be implemnted and rolled out for use.
maintenance: This is the phase where the software will have to be regularly maintained to ensure it is always running smoothly.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile is more flexible while waterfall has a fixed timeline.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The key difference is that Agile methodology is flexible and iterative while Waterfall methodology is fixed. in situation when the prject deliverables and timeline are concrete we can use waterfall methodology since the start and end time is concrete. in situations where ite start and end time of the project is tentative and not concrete we use agile methodology as it is flexible and iterative.

Requirements Engineering:
Requirements engineering is the process of explaining, documenting, and maintaining requirements of an  engineering design process.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of explaining, documenting, and maintaining requirements of an  engineering design process. The importance is that it helps software engineers better comprehend the problem they are working on.

Software Design Principles:
These are principles are essential guidelines that enables the creation of well-structured and maintainable software codes and systems.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts. By breaking it into digegstable parts, sections of codes can easily be maintained thereby enabling the scalability of software systems.

Testing in Software Engineering:
This is the process of esecuting a software to find errors so it can be fixed.


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit tests
Unit tests are very low level and close to the source of an application. 
2. Integration tests
Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
3. System tests
System testing replicates a user behavior with the software in a complete application environment.
4. Acceptance testing
Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. 


Version Control Systems:
Version control is the software engineering practice of controlling computer files and versions of files

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control is the software engineering practice of controlling computer files and versions of files. They are important because they help our files to be consistent. Examples of version controls are Github, Gitlab, and Heroku.

Software Project Management:
Software project management is the process of planning and leading software projects. It is a sub-discipline of project management.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? 
The role of a software project manager is to plan and lead software projects. 

Software Maintenance:
Software maintenance is the modification of a software product after delivery.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the modification of a software product after delivery.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
This is the  Promoting and safeguarding the public interest and individual health and safety.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Algometric bias and personal data collection.


Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
